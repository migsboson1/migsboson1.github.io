      HIS STORY

    <div class="container">
      <div class="text">
        <p>Miguel migrated to the states from Mexico when he was 18 years old.
          He had no family, only one friend, and an immense determination to help
          his family back home. After a few months of searching for a job, he was blessed
          to have found a position as a dish washer at a Japanese restaurant. His
          hard work over the years gradually moved him up to a position as a suhi chef
          where he began to learn the art of sushi. He stayed loyal with the restaurant and worked there for
          more than 25 years.

      </div>
      <div class="text">
      <p>When the business decided to retire and
      sell the restaurant, he made the bold choice of opening his own sushi restaurant.
      Once he had his own restaurant, he had the freedom and creativity to fuse what
      he had learned over the years with his own Mexican culture. Miguel offers delicious
      and traditional sushi as well a unique, fused style known as "miguel style" sushi with
      incredible homemade sauces.
